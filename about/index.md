I'm a software engineer at [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/). Every now and then I have a thought about software engineering, system design, best practices, formalisms, or something like these and I write them down here. Of course, none of the views expressed in this blog are necessarily those of Amazon EC2, they are all my own.

If you're interested in Scholastic philosophy or Christian theology also be sure to check out [my other blog on these topics](https://elliottroland.wordpress.com/).
