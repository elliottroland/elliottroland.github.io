When I studied [category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory) I was struck by how expressive such simple diagrams can be if used correctly. After reading [Lewis and Fowler on microservices](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) I was inspired to develop a somewhat formal "diagrammatic language" for systems in general.
